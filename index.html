            <h1>What is an Article?</h1>
            <p>An article is a short monosyllabic word that is used to define if the 
                <a href="">noun</a>
                is specific or not. Articles are normally used before nouns and since they
                 are used to speak about the noun, they can be considered as adjectives.</p>
            <p class="classp">Look at how various dictionaries define an article to have a much clearer idea of what they are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Definition">
            <h1>Definition of an Article</h1>
            <p>There are three articles in English – ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’. These articles are divided into two types namely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Definite Article</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Indefinite Article</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="DefiniteArticle">
            <h1>Definite Article</h1>
            <p>Among the three articles, ‘the’ is said to be the definite article. A 
            definite article is used to determine something that is specific or 
            particular. It is also used before <a href="">plural nouns</a> and to indicate the 
            <a href="">superlative degree of comparison</a>. Furthermore, it can be used before 
            <a href="">collective nouns</a> as well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <p>For Example</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The</b> Sun sets in <b>the</b> west.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the above sentence, the nouns ‘Sun’ and ‘west’ are 
                <a href="">proper nouns</a> and are specific and so the definite article has
                 to be used.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The</b> children are playing cricket.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the above sentence, the definite article is used 
                to determine the plural noun, ‘children’.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the world’s longest river.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the above sentence, the definite article 
                is used to denote the superlative degree of comparison.</p> 
            <ul>
                <li><b>The</b> crowd sang along with the band.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the above sentence, the definite article is used 
                before the collective nouns, ‘crowd’ and ‘band’.</p>
